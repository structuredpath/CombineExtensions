import Combine

/// A publisher that wraps a single value and emits a new element whenever the value changes.
///
/// `CurrentValuePublisher` is similar to the built-in `CurrentValueSubject`, but it prevents
/// direct modification of the value by clients. It is useful for exposing a `CurrentValueSubject`
/// whose value should only be updated internally.
///
/// This publisher retains its current value, which is accessible at any time. Upon subscription,
/// it emits the current value, followed by any new values as they occur. It also provides operator
/// overloads that apply to both the current and future values.
///
/// `CurrentValuePublisher` can be created with a constant value, an initial value paired with an
/// upstream publisher, or a backing `CurrentValueSubject`.
///
/// If created with an upstream publisher, `CurrentValuePublisher` maintains an active subscription
/// to it until the upstream publisher completes or the `CurrentValuePublisher` is deallocated.
/// Deallocation occurs when all references to the `CurrentValuePublisher` as well as all downstream
/// subscriptions are released.
///
/// ### Development Notes:
/// - Inspired by the `Property` and `MutableProperty` types from ReactiveSwift, particularly their
///   distinction between constant and composed behaviors, as described at https://bit.ly/3c6iWfq.
/// - Although the implementation differs significantly, this gist served as an initial reference:
///   https://gist.github.com/sharplet/14703e2988e38d870198064989263f75.
/// - The storage evolved from a simple value, to a subject, and finally to a `Storage` abstraction
///   with `constant` and `subject` cases.
